Make his fight on the hills in the early day
Constant chill deep inside
Shouting gun on they run through the endless gray
On they fight for their right, yes, but who's to say?

For a hill, men would kill, why? They do not know
[Incomprehensible] wounds test their pride
Men of five, still alive through the raging glow
Gone insane from the pain and they surely know
